    <h1>This is my first web page</h1>
    <p>HTML is the language used to create websites. It stands for HyperText Markup Language. And that is exactly what it is: a markup language for hypertexts. A 'hypertext' is a text in which some of the words are linked to other parts within the text or linked to other (related) pages. A 'hypertext' basically means that the text allows you to jump to other texts or other pages, by just clicking on a word or phrase inside the text. In this way the text no longer has a linear structure like a book, but becomes part of complex collection of texts.</p>
